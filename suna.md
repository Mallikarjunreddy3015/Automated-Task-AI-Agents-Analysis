- Use their own API keys and credentials
- Switch between different models based on task requirements
- Configure model parameters for optimal performance

## Performance
- Comparable functionality to Manus AI and Genspark for common tasks
- Performance depends on the underlying LLM models used
- Optimized for local deployment with reasonable hardware requirements

## Cost Structure
