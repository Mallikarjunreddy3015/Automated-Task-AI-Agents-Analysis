# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions for Automated-Task-AI-Agents-Analysis

This package contains a fixed static website build optimized for GitHub Pages deployment with the repository name "Automated-Task-AI-Agents-Analysis". The build addresses the navigation issues and home tab not loading properly.

## Key Fixes
- Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better GitHub Pages compatibility
- Updated base path to match your repository name: `/Automated-Task-AI-Agents-Analysis/`
- Fixed routing to ensure home page loads on initial visit

## Deployment Steps

1. **Replace your current repository files**
   - Extract this zip file to a local directory
   - Delete all files in your current repository (except the .git folder)
   - Copy all files from the extracted directory to your repository folder

2. **Commit and push the changes**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your repository
   - Run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix navigation and routing issues"
   git push
   ```

3. **Wait for GitHub Pages to update**
   - It may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild your site
   - Your site will be available at:
   - `https://mallikarjunreddy3015.github.io/Automated-Task-AI-Agents-Analysis/`

## Troubleshooting

- If you still experience issues, try clearing your browser cache
- The site now uses hash-based routing (#), so URLs will look like:
  `https://mallikarjunreddy3015.github.io/Automated-Task-AI-Agents-Analysis/#/open-source`
